# Binary to Denary Converter

## Project Overview

This project involves designing, coding, testing, and evaluating a Python program that converts between binary and decimal (denary) numbers. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate two different approaches to solving the problem: using Python's built-in functions and implementing custom algorithms. The project is organised into two branches: `simple` and `complex`.

## Branches

### 1. Simple Branch

The `simple` branch focuses on utilising Python's built-in functions for converting between binary and decimal numbers. This approach is straightforward and leverages Pythonâ€™s powerful standard library to achieve the desired conversions with minimal code.

#### Key Functions Used:
- **`bin()`**: Converts a decimal (integer) number to a binary string.
- **`int()`**: Converts a binary string to a decimal number by specifying the base as 2.

#### Example Usage:
```python
decimal_number = 43
binary_string = bin(decimal_number)[2:]  # Output: '101011'

binary_string = '101011'
decimal_number = int(binary_string, 2)  # Output: 43
```

#### Benefits:
- **Simplicity**: The built-in functions require less code and are easy to understand.
- **Efficiency**: These functions are optimised and perform the conversions quickly.

### 2. Complex Branch

The `complex` branch showcases a manual implementation of algorithms to convert between binary and decimal numbers. This approach shows the logic behind the conversions and how these processes work under the hood.

#### Custom Algorithms:

- **Decimal to Binary**:
  - Divides the decimal number by 2 repeatedly.
  - Records the remainders.
  - The binary equivalent is formed by reading the remainders in reverse order.

- **Binary to Decimal**:
  - Iterates over each bit in the binary string.
  - Multiplies each bit by the power of 2 corresponding to its position.
  - Sums all these values to get the decimal equivalent.

#### Example Code:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "0"
    binary = []
    while n > 0:
        binary.append(str(n % 2))
        n = n // 2
    binary.reverse()
    return ''.join(binary)

def binary_to_decimal(b):
    decimal_value = 0
    power = 0
    for digit in reversed(b):
        decimal_value += int(digit) * (2 ** power)
        power += 1
    return decimal_value
```

#### Benefits:
- **Educational Value**: Provides insight into the manual process of conversion, which is valuable for understanding binary arithmetic.
- **Customisation**: Allows for more control over the conversion process, which can be modified or extended as needed.
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Encourages thinking in terms of algorithms and problem-solving.
- **Error Handling**: Provides the opportunity to implement custom error handling logic.
- **Scalability**: Can be extended to handle larger numbers or additional conversion types.
- **Performance Analysis**: Allows for a detailed performance analysis of the custom algorithms.

## Testing

Both branches have been tested with various inputs to ensure correctness. The test cases include:
- Converting a range of decimal numbers (e.g., 0, 1, 43, 255) to binary and verifying the output.
- Converting a range of binary strings (e.g., '0', '1', '101011', '11111111') to decimal and verifying the output.
- Handling invalid inputs, such as non-binary strings or out-of-range decimal numbers, and ensuring appropriate error messages are displayed.

### Test Plan and Results:

| Test Case                        | Input                | Expected Output                | Simple Branch Output  | Complex Branch Output | Pass/Fail |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Convert decimal 43 to binary     | Decimal: 43          | Binary: 101011                 | 101011                 | 101011                 | Pass      |
| Convert binary 101011 to decimal | Binary: 101011       | Decimal: 43                    | 43                     | 43                     | Pass      |
| Convert decimal 0 to binary      | Decimal: 0           | Binary: 0                      | 0                      | 0                      | Pass      |
| Convert binary 0 to decimal      | Binary: 0            | Decimal: 0                     | 0                      | 0                      | Pass      |
| Invalid binary input             | Binary: 102          | Error message                  | Error message          | Error message          | Pass      |
| Invalid decimal input            | Decimal: 300         | Error message                  | Error message          | Error message          | Pass      |

## Evaluation

### Comparison of Methods:
- **Simplicity vs. Understanding**: The `simple` branch demonstrates the ease of using built-in Python functions, making it the best choice for quick and efficient development. However, the `complex` branch offers a detailed view of the underlying logic, which is useful for educational purposes.
- **Performance**: The built-in functions in the `simple` branch are highly optimised and perform faster than the custom algorithms in the `complex` branch. However, for the given problem size (values up to 255), the performance difference is negligible.

### Potential Improvements:
- **Complex Branch**:
  - Extend the custom algorithm to handle larger numbers and negative integers.
  - Implement additional error handling for non-numeric input.
- **Simple Branch**:
  - While the simple branch is already efficient, adding more detailed comments could improve code readability and understanding.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates two different approaches to solving the binary-decimal conversion problem. By exploring both the simplicity of built-in functions and the complexity of manual algorithms, the project showcases a balanced understanding of Python programming and binary arithmetic.
